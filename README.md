## Design

As this is an educational game website for children it is catered to children, I decided to use bright colours that are cheerful and playful. The pictures in the game are chosen for children who would enjoy seeing the characters but also motivate them to learn.

### Logo

The base logo was found on the [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) website. But it wasnâ€™t clear when it was displayed on the website. So I made some changes with Photoshop and made the background transparent to display it better.

The tetradic colour scheme is used for this website.
Based on the colours of the colour chart shown below. Different lightness and opacity are used all over this website.
