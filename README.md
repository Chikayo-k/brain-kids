### Logo

The base logo was found on the [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) website. But it wasn’t clear when it was displayed on the website. So I made some changes with Photoshop and made the background transparent to display it better.

![Logo image](./assets/docs/design/logo.png)

### Colour Scheme

The tetradic colour scheme is used for this website.
Based on the colours of the colour chart shown below. Different lightness and opacity are used all over this website.

![Colour wheel image](./assets/docs/design/colour-wheel.png)
![Colour chart image](./assets/docs/design/colour-chart.png)

These different lightness are used for background colours of buttons to give better contrast.

Social media icon colours are referenced from the [U.S BRAND COLOURS](https://usbrandcolors.com/)

### Fonts

The Afacad font style was chosen for this website. It is clear and easy to read. [Google fonts: Afacad](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Afacad)

### Top main page

- The introduction section explains to users what this game is like and explains how to play

- The image uses children playing with an abacus which gives users the understanding this game is related to mathematics for children

This section provides users with an understanding of the aim of the game. The audio button benefits users by having controls for the sound. To place the score button just under the start button, the user will see that there is a scoreboard feature. They can check their progress between games. With the big red standout start button, users can see at a glance where the start button is to start this game.

### Game Page

- Shows addition and subtraction questions generated by random numbers according to your current level.
- Level is displayed on the top of the question and when the level goes up the colour of the text will change to green for one second
- Score and life points are displayed at the bottom of the question if the answer is correct it will be increased by 1 otherwise it won’t change but the Life points will be decreased.
- On the right-hand side it shows four possible answers that a user needs to pick from.
- A bunny will be shown for 0.7 seconds whether the answer clicked is correct or not
- If the Audio is on, sound effects can be heard depending on what the users have selected whether the answer is correct or not.

Questions can be seen easily by users. When the levels increase the colour of the level text will change to green for 0.7 seconds this will let users know that the level is increasing.
Answers are options that can be clicked to make their choice. The user has clear feedback from a little bunny which will pop up to show whether the answer the user clicked was correct or not.
When the audio is on sound effects give the users the same feedback.

### Game Over

- Show the message “Game Over” on the screen and the score the user has gained for this attempt under it.
- The home button is to go back to the main page where you can start the game again as well as access the other pages.

This provides the user with clear feedback that the game is over. By checking the score user can confirm how many questions they answered correctly in this attempt. The red background Home button is a clear navigation for the user to go back to the main page where they have access to do the game again, check the score, change the audio setting or sign up for a subscription.

### Score Page

- The highest score is shown at the top of the page. This is stored in local storage so that it won’t be deleted until the reset all button on the right side is clicked or the page is closed.
- Attempt score is stored in an array so it will add the score every time the game is finished. It will disappear if you reload the page.
- The logo at the top of the page will refresh and clear if the screen is closed. The reset all button will also remove the attempt scores.
- Back button brings you back to the main page
- The Reset All button deletes the highest score and attempt score.

This benefits the users as they can see how their scores are improving by checking the scoreboard.

## Bugs / Improvements

### Lighthouse

The lighthouse feature in Google Chrome shows the issue of having some buttons that have low-contrast text. This brings the accessibility score down.

![Contrast issue image](./assets/docs/bugs-improvements/contrast-issue.png)

To solve this, I followed the advice and changed the lightness of the background colour of the buttons. And the accessibility score went up to 100%.

![Contrast fix issue image](./assets/docs/bugs-improvements/contrast-fix.png)

### HTML

HTML validation gave me the issue of an empty heading. I didn’t write any word intentionally at the beginning as this will be generated by JavaScript. Instead of emptying this, I wrote a draft in the heading in case JavaScript cannot work to show the text.

![HTML validation warning image](./assets/docs/bugs-improvements/html-warning.png)

### JavaScript

There was a warning when my JavaScript file was tested saying the body of a for in should be wrapped in an if statement to filter unwanted properties from the prototype.

![Warning of JSHint image](./assets/docs/bugs-improvements/jshint-issue.png)

![Issue of the loop image](./assets/docs/bugs-improvements/loop.png)

I searched [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1963102/what-does-the-jslint-error-body-of-a-for-in-should-be-wrapped-in-an-if-statemen) and it recommends using an older style for loop to solve the issue. So I rewrote the code again and it got rid of the warning.

![Stack Overflow solution image](./assets/docs/bugs-improvements/stack-overflow.png)

## Validation

As all of the issues were resolved the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript validation all passed.

### [HTML Validation](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri)

![HTML validation image](./assets/docs/validation/html-validation.png)

### [CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

![CSS validation image](./assets/docs/validation/css-validation.png)

### [Javascript Validation](https://jshint.com/)

The JSHint validator has no error.

- However, there are warnings. The signupBtn and the StartPage variables are undefined. I can ignore them because these are used across 2 separate JavaScript files and they have already been declared.

- Warning saying declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics. I decided to ignore the warning as this was just a warning and it didn’t have any impact on the project.
